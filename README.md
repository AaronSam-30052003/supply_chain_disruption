#Supply Chain Risk Prediction System
This project is a web-based application built with FastAPI for predicting supply chain risk factors using a trained XGBoost model. The app provides an intuitive interface for inputting supply chain parameters and visualizing data insights.
#Features
Risk Factor Prediction: Predicts supply chain disruption risk using user-provided parameters.
Dashboard Visualization: Displays visual insights like inventory status by region.
Email Alerts: Sends notifications for high-risk predictions.
Interactive Form: User-friendly form for submitting input data.
Data Visualizations: Built with Matplotlib and Seaborn for better decision-making.
