# Supply Chain Risk Prediction System

This project is a web-based application built with FastAPI for predicting supply chain risk factors using a trained XGBoost model. The app provides an intuitive interface for inputting supply chain parameters and visualizing data insights.

## Features

1.Risk Factor Prediction: Predicts supply chain disruption risk using user-provided parameters.

2.Dashboard Visualization: Displays visual insights like inventory status by region.

3.Email Alerts: Sends notifications for high-risk predictions.

4.Interactive Form: User-friendly form for submitting input data.

5.Data Visualizations: Built with Matplotlib and Seaborn for better decision-making.

## Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: XGBoost

Database: Environment-based setup (optional)

Email Integration: SMTP

Environment Variables: Managed using dotenv

## Usage

Home Page: Input features like year, region, inventory, and more to predict the risk factor.

Dashboard: View graphical insights on inventory and disruptions by region.

Email Alerts: Receive notifications for high-risk factors above the threshold.
